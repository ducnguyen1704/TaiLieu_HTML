      <h2>What is Cryptography?</h2>
   
      <p><b>Cryptography</b> is the science of secure communications, 
         formed from the Greek words <i>krypt&#243;s</i> meaning "hidden" 
         and <i>l&#243;gos</i>, meaning "word." The first recorded use of cryptography 
         was by the Spartans who as early as 400 BC employed a cipher device called a 
         scytale to send secret communications between military 
         commanders. The scytale consisted of a tapered baton around which was wrapped 
         a piece of parchment inscribed with the message. Once unwrapped the parchment 
         appeared to contain an incomprehensible set of letters; however when wrapped 
         around another baton of identical size the original text appears.

      <p >Cryptographers developed more and more ingenious systems, 
         but it was in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century that the science of cryptography took 
         off. The first major achievement was the development of rotor cipher machines. 
         An American, Edward Hebern recognized that by hardwiring alphabetic substitution in 
         the connections from one side of an electrical rotor to those on the other side and 
         cascading a collection of such rotors, alphabetic substitutions of almost any 
         complexity could be produced. German engineers independently discovered the rotor 
         concept and designed the precursors to the most famous cipher machine in history
         &ndash; the German Enigma machine which was used during World War II. The cracking 
         of the Enigma ciphers by British and Polish cryptanalysts is one of the
         greatest triumphs in the history of cryptography and played an important role in 
         the Allied victory.
